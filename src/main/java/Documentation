**Student Management System - Backend Instruction Report**

---

### Project Overview:
This is a backend-only project for managing a Student Management System using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL. The system handles student registration, course enrollments, ID card management, college/university hierarchy, faculty mapping, and academic grading.

### Core Entities & Relationships:

1. **University**
   - Has many Colleges (One-to-Many)

2. **College**
   - Belongs to one University (Many-to-One)
   - Has many Students (One-to-Many)

3. **Department**
   - Has many Courses (One-to-Many)
   - Has many Faculty (One-to-Many)

4. **Course**
   - Belongs to one Department (Many-to-One)
   - Has many Students (Many-to-Many)

5. **Student**
   - Belongs to one College (Many-to-One)
   - Has one ID Card (One-to-One)
   - Enrolls in many Courses (Many-to-Many)
   - Has many Grades (One-to-Many)

6. **ID Card**
   - Belongs to one Student (One-to-One)

7. **Faculty**
   - Belongs to one Department (Many-to-One)
   - Can teach multiple Courses (One-to-Many)

8. **Grade**
   - Belongs to one Student (Many-to-One)
   - Belongs to one Course (Many-to-One)

### Backend Features:

- Add/Update/Delete Students, Colleges, Universities
- Assign students to colleges
- Enroll students in courses
- Map faculties and departments
- Generate and manage ID cards
- Store and retrieve academic grades
- Filter/search students by name, course, college, university
- Role-based authentication (future add-on)
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

---

### Functionality Provided to the User:

1. **Admin Users Can:**
   - Register new universities and colleges
   - Manage departments and assign faculty
   - Register new students with ID card generation
   - Assign students to colleges and departments
   - Enroll students in courses
   - View and update student profiles
   - Input and update grades for student-course combinations
   - Search and filter students by multiple criteria (college, course, name, etc.)
   - Generate reports (students per college, course stats, etc.)

2. **Student (Future Roles):**
   - View their ID card and academic profile
   - Check course enrollments and grades
   - Request course enrollment (admin approval)

3. **Faculty (Future Roles):**
   - View assigned courses
   - Access list of enrolled students
   - Add grades and attendance (if implemented)

### ⚙️ Technologies Used:

- Spring Boot (REST API Framework)
- Spring Data JPA (ORM)
- MySQL (Database)
- Lombok (Boilerplate removal)
- Swagger (API Documentation)
- Validation Annotations (Form-level validation)

---

### Next Steps:

1. Set up Spring Boot project in Eclipse
2. Create MySQL schema and configure `application.properties`
3. Build entity classes with mappings
4. Create repository interfaces
5. Implement service layer
6. Expose controller endpoints
7. Test using Postman or Swagger
