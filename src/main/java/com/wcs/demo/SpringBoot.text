1. Introduction to Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications. It eliminates the need for extensive configuration, boilerplate code, and reduces development time. With Spring Boot, developers can create stand-alone, production-grade applications that "just run" with minimal setup.

Key Concepts:
*What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is part of the larger Spring Framework. It is designed to make the development of Spring-based applications easier by:

Reducing boilerplate configuration code.

Providing embedded web servers (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow).

Enabling rapid application development with minimal setup.

*Advantages of Using Spring Boot:

Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot takes care of most of the configuration for you, based on the libraries you include in your project.

Embedded Servers: You don't need to install or configure a separate web server (e.g., Tomcat). Spring Boot uses embedded servers that are bundled with the application.

Minimal Configuration: It reduces the need for complex XML or Java-based configuration. Most of the configuration is done automatically or via simple property files.

Production-Ready: Features like health checks, metrics, and logging are included out of the box.

*Spring Boot vs. Traditional Spring Framework:

Traditional Spring: Requires extensive setup (e.g., configuration files, context initialization).

Spring Boot: Simplifies configuration with automatic configurations and provides built-in defaults.

Spring Boot makes it possible to create Spring applications with minimal setup, reducing the complexity of Java-based Spring applications.

Spring Boot Auto-Configuration:

Auto-Configuration is one of the key features of Spring Boot. It automatically configures beans and services based on the libraries included in the application. For example, if Spring Boot detects that you have a spring-boot-starter-web dependency, it will automatically configure a Tomcat server.

You can customize auto-configuration behavior through application.properties or application.yml.

*Spring Boot Starters:

Starters are a set of pre-configured dependencies that can be easily added to a project to get the required functionality.

Examples of starters include:

spring-boot-starter-web: For building web applications, including REST APIs.

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For integrating Spring Data JPA with Spring Boot.

spring-boot-starter-security: For integrating Spring Security into your application.

spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf: For integrating Thymeleaf for server-side rendering.

*Spring Boot Project Structure:

When you generate a Spring Boot project (typically using Spring Initializr), it follows a standard directory structure:

src
├── main
│   ├── java
│   │   └── com
│   │       └── example
│   │           └── demo
│   │               └── DemoApplication.java
│   ├── resources
│   │   ├── application.properties
│   │   └── static (static content like CSS, JS)
│   └── templates (for Thymeleaf templates)
└── test
    └── java
        └── com
            └── example
                └── demo
                    └── DemoApplicationTests.java
src/main/java: Contains Java source code.

src/main/resources: Contains configuration files like application.properties, and resources like static content (CSS, JavaScript), and templates (for Thymeleaf).

src/test/java: Contains unit and integration tests.

*Spring Boot Dependencies:

Spring Boot uses a Maven or Gradle dependency management system.

By including the appropriate dependencies in your pom.xml (for Maven) or build.gradle (for Gradle), you can easily add features like web, data access, security, and more.

Spring Boot Command-Line Interface (CLI):

Spring Boot CLI is a tool that allows you to run and test Spring Boot applications from the command line. It's useful for quick prototyping and testing without setting up an IDE.

*Spring Maven Vs Gradle

Maven and Gradle are both popular build tools in the Java ecosystem, and they serve the same purpose:
to automate the build process, handle dependencies, and manage project lifecycles.
However, they differ in the approach they take and the syntax they use.

**Maven:
XML-based configuration: Maven uses XML (pom.xml) for project configuration.

Convention over Configuration: Maven follows strict conventions for project structure,
which can be a bit restrictive, but it simplifies the setup process.

Widely adopted: Maven has been around longer and is widely adopted in many Java projects.

Maven Lifecycle: It has a predefined build lifecycle consisting of phases such as compile,
test, package, and install.

Declarative: The pom.xml file is declarative, meaning you define what dependencies and plugins
you need, and Maven takes care of the rest.

**Gradle:
  Groovy/Kotlin-based configuration: Gradle uses Groovy or Kotlin DSL (build.gradle or build.gradle.kts).

  Highly customizable: Gradle is more flexible and allows fine-grained control over the build process.

  Performance: Gradle offers better performance with features like incremental builds and parallel task execution.

  Gradle Lifecycle: Gradle does not have a strict lifecycle but provides a more flexible task execution model.

  Imperative: Gradle is more imperative, meaning you describe how to execute tasks in the build lifecycle.

 ** pom.xml for Maven
 The pom.xml (Project Object Model) file is the core configuration file for Maven. It contains metadata about the project
 (such as name, version, dependencies), build configuration, and plugin settings.

 ** build.gradle for Gradle
   The build.gradle file is the core configuration file for Gradle.
   It uses a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL to define the build process.
